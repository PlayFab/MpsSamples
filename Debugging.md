# Debugging your Game Servers

Many debugging tasks of PlayFab Multiplayer Servers can be done locally using [LocalMultiplayerAgent](https://github.com/PlayFab/LocalMultiplayerAgent). However, sometimes the behavior of the game server can differ between  the local environment and the actual service so you would like to connect directly to debug a running server because it is marked as unhealthy or not performing as expected.

In order to connect to the VM hosting your game server (either Windows or Linux), you can get RDP/SSH credentials using the "Connect" button on playfab.com web application (you can see this button on the "Virtual Machines" page on your Multiplayer Build) or using [CreateRemoteUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/multiplayer/multiplayerserver/createremoteuser?view=playfab-rest) API call.

As soon as you connect to the VM, you can use the console of the operating system to monitor your game servers. MPS service uses Docker containers to spin up game server processes. To run Docker CLI commands, you'll need an admin powershell on Windows and `sudo su -` on Linux.

**These are advanced Docker container debugging instructions, usage of them might break your game servers. We do not recommend using these commands on containers running your production game servers.**.

**We strongly advise you not to take any dependency on behavior or information you see while debugging the containers. Only publicly documented APIs and behavior are supported, other things can change without notice.**

## Instructions for both Windows and Linux

### How can I get started with Docker containers?

Regardless if you're developing on Linux or Windows, you should get acquainted with the basics of Docker containers. You can watch the official "Get Started" video [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and experiment in an interactive playground [here on Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker). Furthermore, feel free to see information about Windows Containers [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/).

### Once I RDP/SSH into the VM, how can I see a list of my running game servers running in Docker containers?

Use `docker ps`. You will see container name and hashes as well as port mapping from the VM port(s) to the Docker container port(s).

### How can I see the ports used by my game servers?

This information is listed on `docker ps`. You will see something like that:

```
980d7e80457265230a0bf   "/bin/sh -c ./cppLinâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:30000->3600/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30001->3601/udp  great_archimedes
```

In this case, port 30000 on the VM is mapped onto 3600 on the container for TCP whereas 30001 on the VM is mapped on 3601 on the container for UDP. For more information for Docker networking, check [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/).

> In both Windows and Linux, Docker containers are part of the "playfab" Docker network. You can do `docker inspect network playfab` to see information about the network.

### How can I see runtime details for a container?

Once you do `docker ps` you can grab the container name or hash and do `docker inspect <nameOrHash>`. You will see lots of information, like the state of the container, the volume binding on the host VM, port bindings, environment variables passed into the container and more.

### How can I get the logs of my game server?

You can use the command `docker logs <nameOrHash>`. These logs contain everything your app sends to standard output/standard error streams. Bear in mind that these logs exist only for *existing* containers. If your game server crashes, our monitoring process in the VM will delete this container and create a new one.

Consequently, it's a better practice to use GSDK to log from inside your game server. Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/integrating-game-servers-with-gsdk#logging-with-the-gsdk) for logging with GSDK and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/archiving-and-retrieving-multiplayer-server-logs) for accessing the logs from terminated game servers.

### Can I connect "inside" a running container to see what's going on?

Yup! You can do `docker exec -it <nameOrHash> powershell` on Windows and `docker exec -it <nameOrHash> bash` on Linux. There, you get access to a command line process in the container where you can issue native commands to debug/diagnose issues.

> For this command to work on Linux, Bash shell must be installed in your base container. If it isn't, you can use Bourne shell by running `docker exec -it <nameOrHash> sh`.

### How can I see the ports that are open on my container?

Once you are connected "inside" the container, you can use `netstat -ano` on Windows and `netstat -tulpn` on Linux when you have a command line process inside your container (check the previous instruction).

> If this command doesn't work on Linux, try installing netstat by `apt update && apt install net-tools`
> On Linux, you can use `nestatst -tulpn` inside the VM to see that the ports are indeed open. Recall that VM ports will be different than container ports, you can see this port mapping with `docker ps` for your containers.

## Linux specific instructions

### How can I see diagnostics about my container?

You can install `apt install procps` and then run:

- `ps -aux` for the current running processes (observer that your main process in the container has a PID of 1. If this process dies, your container will be gone)
- `top` for real time process information

### How can I monitor TCP and UDP packets?

You can use tcpdump utility. `apt update && apt install tcpdump` to install it. In order to use it for a specific port, you can do `tcpdump port 7777` for TCP and `tcpdump udp port 7778` for UDP. For more details, you can check [here](https://www.hugeserver.com/kb/install-use-tcpdump-capture-packets/).

It is worth mentioning that you can use tcpdump both from inside the VM and from inside the container. However, ensure that you will be monitoring for the correct port value, since there is a port mapping between VM ports and container ports.

## Windows specific instructions

### How can I determine the required DLLs that need to be in my asset package?

You can follow the steps in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/determining-required-dlls). This article is also useful if your game server fails to start because of one or more missing DLLs.

### LocalMultiplayerAgent is crashing and restarting my Docker container with no error messages. Help!

In these cases, you might see an output similar as this:

```

```

Steps you can follow to debug:

- Check `PF_ConsoleLogs.txt` for any useful error message
- Check if your .zip asset package contains all the required DLLs for your game (refer to the [previous instruction](#how-can-i-determine-the-required-dlls-that-need-to-be-in-my-asset-package))
- Check Windows Event log to see if there's any useful information about Docker failures

### On LocalMultiplayerAgent, I am not getting any heartbeats

There might be some leftover containers from previous attempts. You can use `docker ps -a` to see all containers and `docker rm -f <containerNameOrTag>` to delete them.

### On Windows, how can I monitor TCP and UDP packets?

You can try the [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) utility.

### How can I debug a deployed multiplayer server using Visual Studio?

We have some instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/servers/allocating-game-servers-and-configuring-vs-debugging-tools#debugging-a-deployed-multiplayer-server)

## Can I contribute to this guide?

Absolutely! Feel free to open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdksamples/pulls) with your instructions and we'd be more than happy to review and merge.
